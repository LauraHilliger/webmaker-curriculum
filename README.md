#Web Literacy Clubs curriculum (NEXT)

The "Next" branch of the Web Literacy Clubs curriculum repository is a place to tinker freely on new or experimental modules for Web Literacy Clubs. This work is half baked (while the Master branch is three-quarters baked ;)

Please see the Master branch for a full description of the Clubs curriculum and initiative.
