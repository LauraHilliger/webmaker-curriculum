                                Introduce the session by saying that we will <b>build on what we've learned so far</b> and use <b>web storytelling technqiues</b> to share our own journey and reflect where we would like to go from here.

                                    A good "Story of Self" has three parts:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Me.</b> Start your story with who you are. This helps your audience to understand your perspective and grounds your story in your voice and experience. Focus on an aspect of your life where you faced a challenge and made a choice. For example, why did you decide to come to this group?</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li><b>Us.</b> An effective story bridges your personal perspective with your audiences. In this part, explain why your story is relevant to your audience. What challenges and choices await them? For example, as a group, what obstacles will face you after today, and what choices do you have in response? Will you continue to meet and learn together? What will that look like? </li>
                                    <br>                                    
                                    <li><b>Now.</b> You want your audience to leave feeling like they can take action, and that they know what that action is. Present your idea of what the opportunity for now is. For example, do you think the group should continue meeting every month? Do you want to stay in touch online? Give concrete steps of what can be done next. </li>
                                </ul>
